AI Reflection — Sportradar Coding Academy 2026 Project
-------------------------------------------------------

This reflection explains how I used AI tools (ChatGPT) during the creation of my
Sports Event Calendar project and which parts were written by me.

 

1. Parts written and implemented by me
--------------------------------------
- I designed the database schema and ER diagram (sport, team, venue, event).
- I installed and configured PostgreSQL locally, created schema.sql and seed.sql,
  and verified them in pgAdmin.
- I built and ran the FastAPI application and fixed connection errors.
- I structured the repository and created commits.
- I prepared the README and AI_Reflection documentation.

 

2. Parts generated or influenced by AI
--------------------------------------
- I used ChatGPT to:
  - Write DBML syntax for dbdiagram.io to generatw ER.
  - Suggest an initial FastAPI project structure (db.py, models.py, schemas.py, crud.py, main.py).
  - Generate code structure for endpoints and service separation .
  - Explain SQLAlchemy relationships and environment variable usage.

After receiving AI suggestions, I:
  - Reviewed every generated file line by line.
  - Tested all endpoints manually.
  - Fixed any mismatches in naming or logic (e.g., event–team relationships, local DB URL).
  - Modified AI-generated text to fit my style, naming conventions, and PostgreSQL setup.

 

3. Evaluation of AI output
--------------------------
- I corrected several issues, such as database connection strings,
  event relationship naming, and field normalization.
 

4. Technical Decisions
----------------------
- Chose **FastAPI** because it demonstrates clean, asynchronous backend design
  and strong typing with Pydantic models.
- Used **SQLAlchemy ORM** to ensure object-oriented handling of database logic.
- Chose **PostgreSQL** for data consistency and relational enforcement.

 

5. Possible Improvements
-------------------------
If I had more time, I would:
- Add a frontend form with real-time validation and an edit/delete feature.
- Add user authentication and role management.
- Deploy the app on Docker for portability.
- Include continuous integration tests (e.g., GitHub Actions).

 

6. Reflection Summary
----------------------
AI helped me structure and speed up implementation, but every piece of logic,
database design, and testing step was fully verified and customized by me.
AI served as a mentor and assistant, not a code generator to copy blindly.
This process deepened my understanding of database modeling, FastAPI,
and backend development principles.
